# Service Configuration Reference

This is a comprehensive reference. See also {doc}`../how-to/configuration` for a
practical guide with examples.

## Configuration merging rules

If there are multiple configuration files:

* At most one may contain an ``authentication:`` section.
* More than one may contain a ``tree:`` section, but if the same ``path``
  occurs in more than one file, or if colliding paths like ``/a`` and ``/a/b``
  are specified, an exception will be raised.
* If there is more than one ``allow_origins`` section their contents are merged.
* The behavior of other top-level collisions are currently undefined and will
  likely be made strict in the future.

The content below is automatically generated from a schema that is used
to validate configuration files when they are read.

(schema_trees)=
## trees

This section contains a *list* of one or more items,
each describing a Tree to be served.


(schema_trees.tree)=
### trees[item].tree

Type of tree to serve. This may be:

- The string `files`, a shorthand for serving a directory of files.
- An import path to a Tree *instance*.
- An import path to a callable (function or type) that returns a
  Tree. For these, the `args:` parameter below must be used as well.

In an import path, packages/modules are separated by dots,
and the object itself it separated by a colon.

Examples:

    # Tree instances
    tiled.examples.generated_minimal:tree
    tiled examples.generated:demo
    my_python_module:my_tree_instance

    # Callables that return Tree instances
    tiled.trees.files:Tree.from_directory
    my_python_module:CustomTree


(schema_trees.path)=
### trees[item].path

URL subpath for to serve this Tree on.
A good default choice is `"/"` if you are serving
one Tree.


(schema_trees.args)=
### trees[item].args

If `tree:` is set to `files` or some callable that returns a
Tree, this parameter must be included. It may contain named
arguments to pass to the callable. It may be empty or `null` if the
callable requires no arguments.

Example:

```yaml
- path: "/"
  tree: tiled.trees.files:Tree.from_directory
  args:
    directory: "path/to/files"
```


(schema_authentication)=
## authentication

This section describes whether and how to authenticate users.

(schema_authentication.authenticator)=
### authentication.authenticator

Type of Authenticator to use.

These are typically from the tiled.authenticators module,
though user-defined ones may be used as well.

This is given as an import path. In an import path, packages/modules
are separated by dots, and the object itself it separated by a colon.

Example:

```yaml
authenticator: tiled.examples.DummyAuthenticator
```


(schema_authentication.args)=
### authentication.args

Named arguments to pass to Authenticator. If there are none,
`args` may be omitted or empty.

Example:

```yaml
authenticator: tiled.examples.PAMAuthenticator
args:
  service: "custom_service"
```


(schema_authentication.secret_keys)=
### authentication.secret_keys

Secret keys used to sign secure tokens.

When generating a secret, is important to produce a difficult-to-guess
random number, and make it different each time you start up a server.
Two equally good ways to generate a secure secret...

With ``openssl``:

    openssl rand -hex 32

With ``python``:

    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"


(schema_authentication.allow_anonymous_access)=
### authentication.allow_anonymous_access

If true, allow unauthenticated, public access to any entries
that are not specifically controlled with an access policy.

Default is false.


(schema_authentication.single_user_api_key)=
### authentication.single_user_api_key

Secret API key used in single-user deployments.

When generating a secret, is important to produce a difficult-to-guess
random number, and make it different each time you start up a server.
Two equally good ways to generate a secure secret...

With ``openssl``:

    openssl rand -hex 32

With ``python``:

    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
  


(schema_authentication.access_token_max_age)=
### authentication.access_token_max_age

This controls how often fresh access token have to be
re-issued. The process is transparent to the user and just affects performance.
An *access* token cannot be revoked, so its lifetime should be short. The
default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).

Units are **seconds**.


(schema_authentication.refresh_token_max_age)=
### authentication.refresh_token_max_age

Time after which inactive sessions
(sessions that have not refreshed tokens) will time out.
Default is

Units are **seconds**.


(schema_authentication.session_max_age)=
### authentication.session_max_age

Even *active* sessions are timed out after this
limit, and the user is required to resubmit credentials. By default,
this is unset and active session are never shut down.


(schema_allow_origins)=
## allow_origins

This list of domains enables web apps served from other domains to make
requests to the tiled serve.

Example:

```yaml
allow_origins:
  - https://chart-studio.plotly.com
```

(schema_uvicorn)=
## uvicorn

(schema_uvicorn.host)=
### uvicorn.host

Bind socket to this host. Use `--host 0.0.0.0` to make the application
available on your local network. IPv6 addresses are supported, for
for example --host `'::'`. Default `'127.0.0.1'`.


(schema_uvicorn.port)=
### uvicorn.port

Bind to a socket with this port. Default `8000`.

(schema_uvicorn.workers)=
### uvicorn.workers

Use multiple worker processes. Defaults to the `$WEB_CONCURRENCY`
environment variable if available, or `1`.


(schema_uvicorn.root_path)=
### uvicorn.root_path

Configure the application with a root_path when it is behind a proxy
serving it on some path prefix.


(schema_uvicorn.ssl_keyfile)=
### uvicorn.ssl_keyfile

SSL key file

(schema_uvicorn.ssl_certfile)=
### uvicorn.ssl_certfile

SSL certificate file

(schema_uvicorn.ssl_keyfile_password)=
### uvicorn.ssl_keyfile_password

SSL keyfile password

(schema_uvicorn.ssl_version)=
### uvicorn.ssl_version

SSL version to use (see stdlib ssl module's). Default 2.

(schema_uvicorn.ssl_cert_reqs)=
### uvicorn.ssl_cert_reqs

Whether client certificate is required (see stdlib ssl module's). Default 0.

(schema_uvicorn.ssl_ca_certs)=
### uvicorn.ssl_ca_certs

CA certificates file

(schema_uvicorn.ssl_ciphers)=
### uvicorn.ssl_ciphers

Ciphers to use (see stdlib ssl module's). Default TLSv1.
