# How Tiled Fits into the Ecosystem

## What Tiled is Not

* Tiled is a **not a storage format** like [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/) or
  [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It is expected to
  work well with those formats because they enable efficient chunk-based access,
  but it is designed to work with less modern formats as well, to accept the
  data "as is" and convert it on the fly upon request.
* Tiled is **not a data-browsing or visualization front-end** like
  [Plotly Chart Studio](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/),
  [Vega Voyager](https://vega.github.io/voyager/), or
  [JupyterLab Data Explorer](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-data-explorer)
  but it can be used to serve data into them. (Plotly and Vega both work today;
  the JupyterLab Data Explorer is being investigated.)
* Tiled is **not an application server** like  [Vaex](https://vaex.io/). Tiled
  offers no compute; it is focused only on I/O.
* Tiled is a **not a server for specific data format** like
  [Xpublish](https://xpublish.readthedocs.io/) or
  [JupyterLab HDF5](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-hdf5), though
  it may be possible to build similar things with Tiled easily these formats
  and others.

## Lineage

The originating authors of Tiled have worked on several previous, related
projects.

* [**PIMS**](https://soft-matter.github.io/pims/) (2013, JHU Leheny Lab), or Python
  Image Sequence, abstracts over a variety of image time series formats with a
  lazy-loading, numpy-slicable Python object. It has some goals in common with
  [**Dask Array**](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array.html) but it is tightly
  focused on image time series, which lends it
  [ceratin advantages](https://github.com/danielballan/pims2-prototype/issues/1#issuecomment-595653031)
  for that use case. PIMS is still maintained and widely used, including as a
  dependency of [dask-image](https://github.com/dask/dask-image).
* [**Databroker**](https://blueskyproject.io/databroker)
  (2015, Brookhaven National Laboratory) provides searchable dict-like
  "catalogs" of data with entries that ultimately provide N-dimensional or
  tablular data as PIMS objects or [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  DataFrames respectively. It also provides streaming access to data and is
  tightly coupled to the Bluesky "Document Model" for streaming data.
* [**Intake**](https://intake.readthedocs.org/) (2017, Anaconda Inc.) is similar
  to Databroker in its goals and feature set---searchable catalogs of data that
  ultimately provide standard SciPy data structures---but its intended scope
  is broader than Databroker's, not being tied to the Bluesky "Document
  Model" in particular. It also supports *nested* catalogs and chainable
  search queries. In 2018--2020, Databroker was refactored to become a set of
  Intake drivers.

Intake also has a prototype of an HTTP server, which has not yet been fully
developed into a robust tool. Attempts to rework that server led to the
conclusion that Intake's architecture and API privilege ergonomic *interactive*
use and direct access from Python. The changes neccessary to use it as
library code effectively within a performant service or larger application
would be largely *subtractive*, in tension with its use as a user-facing
interactive exploratory tool.

Which brings us to Tiled (2021, Brookhaven National Laboratory with the Bluesky
Collaboration). Tiled is designed with HTTP-based access as the driving use
case, targeting Python clients, browser-based clients, and clients in other
languages. Tiled is compatible with PIMS for reading image series. Tiled has
search capability and some other features drawn from Databroker. Tiled has a
*Tree* abstraction similar to Intake's *Catalog*, with small but important
differences to suit the server--client interaction. (It is hoped that Tiled
Trees and Intake Catalogs can be made interoperable in the near future.)
Finally, Tiled has an *Adapter* abstraction that is something like an amalgam of
PIMS Readers and Intake's DataSources.

In summary:

* Tiled can use PIMS internally to efficiently slice and read image series.
* Tiled can probably be made interoperate with Intake objects.
* Databroker will evolve to be a thin wrapper around Tiled, adding
  concepts and capabilities specific to the Bluesky "Document Model".
