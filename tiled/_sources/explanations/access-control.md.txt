# Access Control

Tiled offers extensible access control over which users can access
which entries.

This is implemented using an "Access Policy" object, which implements
a given policy for certain types of Tree. It can do this in one of two ways:

1. Brute-force checking the entries one at a time
2. Using a query to narrow down search results to those that
   the authenticated user is allowed to access.

(1) is easier to implement and suitable for small- to medium-sized Trees
in memory or backed by a modestly-sized directory. (2) is necessary for large
Trees backed by databases or other external services.

This is an example of (1):

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: ../../../tiled/examples/toy_authentication.py
```

Each username is mapped to the keys of the entries the user may access.
The special key ``SpecialUsers.public`` designates entries that an
unauthenticated (anonymous) user may access *if* the server is configured to
allow anonymous access. (See {doc}`security`.) The special
``SimpleAccessPolicy.ALL`` designates that the user may access any entry
in the Tree.

Here is an example configuration serving that tree with a
"toy" authenticator that defines some users.

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: ../../../example_configs/toy_authentication.yml
```

If the configuration above is saved at ``config.yml``, it can be served with:

```
ALICE_PASSWORD=secret1 BOB_PASSWORD=secret2 CARA_PASSWORD=secret3 tiled serve config config.yml
```

There are no examples of (2) yet. The interface for doing so has been specified
and will soon be implemented for a MongoDB-backed Tree.
